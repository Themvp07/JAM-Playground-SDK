# **JAM Whitelist Authorizer**

This project implements a **role-based and whitelist authorizer** using the JAM SDK. It allows managing authorized addresses, user roles (admin, participant, observer), and an interactive game where participants answer questions. The results are supervised by observers and administrators.

## **Project Description**

This program uses the JAM SDK to implement a role-based and whitelist authorization system. It includes the following functionalities:

- **Roles**: Admin, participant, and observer.
- **Whitelist**: Only authorized addresses can perform certain actions.
- **Interactive Game**: The participant answers questions defined by the admin.
- **Results**: The game results are supervised by the observer or admin.

The project is designed to be modular and easy to extend, allowing the addition of new questions, roles, or functionalities.

## **JAM SDK Components**

The JAM SDK provides several key tools and structures used in this project. Below is a description of each component and how it integrates into the code:

### **1. `jam-types`**
- **Description**: This crate contains basic types and structures needed to work with services and authorizers in JAM.
- **Components used**:
  - **`Authorizer`**: Represents the JAM system's authorizer. It has two main fields:
    - `code_hash`: A hash representing the program's code.
    - `param`: A parameter that can store additional information (e.g., the admin's address).
  - **`CodeHash`**: Represents a 32-byte hash used to validate if a hash belongs to a list of valid hashes.
  - **`AuthParam`**: A parameter used to store additional data related to authorization.
- **Usage in the project**:
  - `Authorizer` is used to manage the validation of authorized addresses.
  - A `CodeHash` is dynamically generated based on the admin's name and used to verify the authenticity of operations.
  - `AuthParam` is extended with the admin's address to track who performed certain actions.

### **2. `jam-pvm-common`**
- **Description**: Provides common functionalities for working with the PVM (Parity Virtual Machine).
- **Components used**:
  - **Serialization/deserialization functions**: Used to handle data in the format required by the PVM.
  - **Shared data structures**: Facilitate interoperability between different SDK modules.
- **Usage in the project**:
  - It ensures that the data generated by the authorizer is compatible with the PVM execution environment.

### **3. `jam-bootstrap-service`**
- **Description**: A basic service useful for creating initial configurations (genesis) in JAM.
- **Usage in the project**:
  - It is cloned as a reference to understand how to set up a basic service in JAM.

### **4. `jam-null-authorizer`**
- **Description**: A basic authorizer that allows testing without authorization restrictions.
- **Usage in the project**:
  - It is used as a starting point to implement the custom authorizer (`RoleBasedWhitelistAuthorizer`).

### **5. `jam-pvm-build`**
- **Description**: A CLI tool that allows building PVM code blobs for services or authorizers.
- **Usage in the project**:
  - It is used to compile the custom authorizer into a PVM blob that can be deployed in the JAM environment.

## **Running the Project**

Once the environment is set up, you can run the project with the following command:

```
cargo run
```
### **Program Flow**

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Enter the names of the admin, participant, and observer.
   - Define the number of operations the participant can perform.

2. **Menu Options**:
   - Option 1: Set the number of operations (Admin).
   - Option 2: Play (Participant).
   - Option 3: View results (Observer/Admin).
   - Option 4: Show final output and exit.

## **Project Structure**

The project is organized into the following files:

  - **main.rs** :
Contains the main program logic, including the menu options and interaction between roles.
  - **lib.rs** :
Defines auxiliary structures like **Context** and **WhitelistAuthorizer**.
  - **questions.rs** :
CContains the questions and their logic. You can add or modify questions here.
  - **Cargo.toml** :
Lists the project dependencies, including those from the JAM SDK.

## **Customization**
### **Adding Questions**

PYou can add new questions by editing the **questions.rs**. For example:

```
Question {
    text: "Â¿What is the capital of France?".to_string(),
    question_type: "multiple_choice".to_string(),
    options: Some(vec![
        "Paris".to_string(),
        "Londons".to_string(),
        "Berlin".to_string(),
    ]),
    answer: Some("Paris".to_string()),
},
```
### **Modifying Roles and Addresses**

EEdit the **main.rs** file to change predefined addresses or add new roles.
